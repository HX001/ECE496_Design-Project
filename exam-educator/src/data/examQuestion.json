    "question": "This is sample question3. Bob’s best friend Amy has invited him to write the [ECE421] midterm together. The exam requires 1 hour and 30 minutes to complete, but students will have 36 hours to submit the exam. Amy explained to Bob that many of her friends are doing group exams now and it generally leads to a higher grade. She also suggests that it will take less time for them to do the exam together so that they will have extra time to study for another midterm. Should Bob accept Amy’s invitation? "

    "question": "This is sample question4. The ECE361 midterm exam is difficult and it is designed so that students can not find answers online. The exam period is three hours. In the last 20 minutes before the exam ends, Amy messages Bob and asks if he can send her a screenshot of the answer he wrote for the last question, that is worth 10 percent of the entire exam. She promised him that she won't copy his answer; she just wants to learn how he solves the problem. Should Bob help Amy out?"
